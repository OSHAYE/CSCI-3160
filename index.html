    <title>api call</title>
    <!-- google hosts a number of librarys 1 being the ajax extention of jquery below is a link to that library that will load with the document-->
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script>
       // i have chosen to seperate the city from the url in place of a string variable so that i may use the api for different citys 
       // the variable can be replaced with another city or a city followed by country in the form such that that ex. london,uk
        var city ="London";

        $(document).ready(function () {
            // because of the nature of the jquery library the line of code above is neededin order to ensure the document is loaded corectly 

            // the line of code below is meant to execute and display the neccassary ajax commands the $('button') tag refers to the button i have declared on the html page however if i had more thatn one it would refer to all buttons 
            $('button').click(function () {
                // ajax requires certain fields in order to make an api request but hass many more optional ones that i did not use
                $.ajax({
                    // the url is required to connect to the desired server/database the url can also be broken up to extract a specifc piece of information but must end with the indivisuals api key 
                    url: "http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" + city + "&units=metric" + "&APPID=d90cd5951fd4b8ac8624654bfe8cec11",
                    // there are 4 ways to interact with an rest api (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) get was specified for the ajax request
                    type: "GET",
                    //we can also determine what format we want the server  to respond in here we specify json for ajaxas it will be the easiest 
                    dataType: 'json',
                    //lastly a function for ajax to complete after  it makes the api request
                    success: function (data) {
                        // in order to distinguish wheather or not our request went through we can console log the incoming data and use the api documentation to filter what we want
                     
                    console.log(data.weather[0].main);
